# planets
A 2D orbital mechanics/gravity simulator game written purely in JavaScript and HTML5.

TODO (infrastructure):
-Document functions to date
-Develop collision detection
-Develop general physics
-Finalise Planet class design
-Design predictive orbits (colour & UI interactions)
-UI for level layout, gross UI interactions

TODO (game mechanics):
-Level design
-Level consumption from JSON
-Level editor

TODO (game idea):
-Start as a particle who wants to be a planet
-Grow to terrestrial planet by collisions, then *avoid* collisions to foster life
-Get ejected from solar system, then gain mass to accrue hydrogen to eventually become a gas giant rogue planet
