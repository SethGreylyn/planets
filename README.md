# planets
A 2D orbital mechanics/gravity simulator game written purely in JavaScript and HTML5.

TODO:
-Add TypeScript to contain madness
-Develop N-body orbital mechanics
    -Use (expensive) nested loop for pairwise interactions, since planets will be reasonably numerous (less than 10 usually)
-Develop planet physics (mass, gravity, density, etc)
-Finalise Planet class design
-Design predictive orbits (colour & UI interactions)
-UI for level layout, gross UI interactions
-Level design
-Level consumption from JSON
-Level editor
